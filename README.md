# W.O.L.F.V.A.M.P.
W.O.L.F.: Watchdog Operations for Lethal Frameworks ; V.A.M.P.: Vulnerability Assessment and Mitigation Protocol

### Description:

This project, undertaken as my final year BTech project, addresses the growing demand for cost-effective security solutions. It delivers a multi-tool IDS/IPS built upon open-source security tools, providing robust threat detection and prevention capabilities at a minimal cost compared to commercial solutions.

### Key Features:

Comprehensive Threat Detection: Leverages a combination of ClamAV, Malwarebytes, Snort/Suricata, and Zeek (Bro) to safeguard against a broad spectrum of threats, including viruses, malware, network intrusions, and emerging attack vectors.
Simplified Management: Prioritizes a user-friendly UI/UX design built with Figma and Tkinter. This ensures easy access, configuration, and clear visualization of security threats for security professionals of all levels.
Automation for Efficiency: Integrates automation scripts to streamline repetitive tasks such as system scans, log analysis, and threat response actions (e.g., quarantines, alerts).
Scalability and Customization: Designed for flexibility to adapt to diverse network environments and security requirements.
Cost-Effectiveness: Utilizes free and open-source tools, minimizing financial burden for organizations.
Technical Stack (Optional):
